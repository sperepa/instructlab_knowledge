Contract clauses

# Termination Clause Criteria
A termination clause outlines the circumstances under which either party can terminate the contract before its agreed-upon end date. This clause is essential as it provides clarity and protection in case of unforeseen events or breaches of contract. For example, a contract between a vendor and a retailer may include a termination clause allowing either party to terminate the agreement if the other party fails to meet certain performance standards. 
When drafting a termination clause, consider including provisions for notice periods, termination fees, and the consequences of termination. It is crucial to ensure that the termination clause is fair and reasonable for both parties and that it aligns with the overall objectives of the contract.
Here are the main criteria for a termination clause:


## Notice Period
"Specify the amount of time a party must provide to the other party before terminating the contract. This allows the other party to prepare and adjust accordingly.
Example: Either party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the other party at least [X] days prior to the termination date.
### Positive example
Either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party.
### Negative example
Either party may terminate this Agreement for any reason without a written notice to the other party.


## Termination for Breach
Define the circumstances under which a party can terminate the contract due to a breach by the other party. This may include non-payment, non-performance, or material default.
Example: If either party fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the defaulting party.
### Positive example
"If either party fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the defaulting party.
If either party fails to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the defaulting party, provided that such notice is given within 30 days of the default. The notice shall specify the breach and the date by which the defaulting party must cure the breach. If the defaulting party fails to cure the breach within the specified timeframe, the non-defaulting party may terminate this Agreement and pursue all available remedies, including but not limited to, damages, injunctive relief, and specific performance."
### Negative example
"If either party fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the defaulting party.
If either party fails to perform any of its material obligations under this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to the defaulting party, provided that such notice is given within 30 days of the default. Upon termination, the non-defaulting party shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available to it under applicable law, including but not limited to, damages, injunctive relief, and specific performance.
If either party fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the defaulting party."


## Termination for Convenience
Allow a party to terminate the contract without cause, but often with a penalty or notice period. This is commonly used in contracts with a fixed term.
Example: Either party may terminate this Agreement without cause upon [X] days' written notice to the other party.
### Positive example
"Example 1: Termination for Convenience Clause with Notice Requirement
Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon 30 days' written notice to the other party.
This clause is well-written because it provides a specific notice requirement for termination, which gives the other party sufficient time to prepare for the termination.
Example 2: Termination for Convenience Clause with Procedure for Handling Assets
Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, and upon termination, each party shall return all assets and property in its possession to the other party within 10 days of receipt of written notice of termination.
This clause is well-written because it provides a specific procedure for handling assets and property in the event of termination, which helps to avoid disputes and uncertainty.
Example 3: Termination for Convenience Clause with Procedure for Handling Liabilities
Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, and upon termination, each party shall assume all liabilities and obligations arising from the Agreement, and shall take all necessary steps to transfer ownership of all assets and property to the other party.
This clause is well-written because it provides a specific procedure for handling liabilities and obligations in the event of termination, which helps to avoid disputes and uncertainty.
Example 4: Termination for Convenience Clause with Dispute Resolution Mechanism
Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time, and upon termination, any disputes arising from the termination shall be resolved through arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
This clause is well-written because it provides a specific mechanism for resolving disputes in the event of termination, which helps to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation.

Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon 30 days' written notice to the other party.

Any disputes arising from the termination shall be resolved through arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association."
### Negative example
"Example 1: Vague Termination for Convenience Clause
Either party may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or no reason.
This clause is poorly written because it is too vague and does not provide any specific procedures or notice requirements for termination.

This clause is poorly written because it does not provide any notice requirement for termination, which can lead to disputes and uncertainty.

## Termination for Insolvency
Specify the circumstances under which a party can terminate the contract due to the insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party.
Example: If either party becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately.
### Positive example
"Example 1: Termination for Insolvency Clause with Specific Notice Requirement
If either party becomes insolvent, files for bankruptcy, or makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, the other party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the defaulting party.
This clause is well-written because it provides a specific notice requirement for termination in the event of insolvency, which gives the defaulting party sufficient time to take action to prevent termination.
